# source-command-cleanup-merged-branch

Use this skill when the user asks to run the migrated source command `cleanup-merged-branch`.

## Command Template

# Agent Workflow: Cleanup Merged Branch

Use this workflow when the user says "branch merged", "cleanup old branch", or "switch to master and pull".

## 1. Context

After a feature branch is merged into `master` via PR, the local feature branch is no longer needed. We should switch back to the main branch, update it, and delete the old local branch to keep the workspace clean.

## 2. Workflow Steps

1.  **Identify Feature Branch**:
    ```bash
    FEATURE_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
    ```
    _(Or ask user which branch if already on master)_
2.  **Switch to Main Branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```
3.  **Pull Latest Changes**:
    ```bash
    git pull origin master
    ```
    _This fetches the merged code._
4.  **Delete Local Feature Branch**:
    ```bash
    git branch -d "$FEATURE_BRANCH"
    ```
    _Use `-d` (safe delete). If it warns about unmerged changes (rare if PR was squash-merged properly), confirm with `git branch -D` only if sure._
5.  **Confirm**: "Switched to `master`, pulled latest code, and deleted `$FEATURE_BRANCH`."

## 3. Example Interaction

**User**: "PR is merged. Cleanup."

**Agent**:

1.  Runs `git checkout master`.
2.  Runs `git pull origin master`.
3.  Runs `git branch -d feature/hardcoded-string-detection`.
4.  Responds: "Updated `master` and deleted local branch `feature/hardcoded-string-detection`."
